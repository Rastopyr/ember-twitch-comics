He built a makeshift device called Cyberno and it helped him to locate Scott. Cerebro started as a simple control pannel built into Professor X's desk. Cerebro soon grew and required a special room in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"\/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\/4020-41138\/\">X-Mansion<\/a>. As years past, Cerebro has since then been replaced by its \"sister\" version called Cerebra and has over the years been used to find or locate many mutants, including some of the best known <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\" href=\"\/x-men\/4060-3173\/\">X-Men<\/a>. Some of them, most notably Scott \"Cyclops\" Summers, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\" href=\"\/jean-grey\/4005-3552\/\">Jean Grey<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"\/emma-frost\/4005-1457\/\">Emma Frost<\/a>, have relied on the device in their roles as X-Men almost as much as Xavier has himself.<\/p><p>At one point the X-Men villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\" href=\"\/bastion\/4005-40568\/\">Bastion<\/a> stole Cerebro from the X-Mansion and merged with it, thus creating a self-aware version. This was done so that the human-<a data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\" href=\"\/sentinels\/4060-4296\/\">Sentinel<\/a> hybrid had a means of better hunting down and killing mutants. This version of Cerebro was eventually neutralized and destroyed by the X-Men.<\/p><p>In recent years, the depiction of Cerebro\/Cerebra in the X-Men comics has undergone a change to reflect the appearance of Cerebro in the popular X-Men films.<\/p><h2>Function<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38880\/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192299\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.0108303249097\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38880\/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192299\"><img alt=\"Emma Frost using Cerebra\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38880\/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/38880\/1192299-551054_uy.jpgntitled_1_cop_super.jpg 277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" data-width=\"277\"><\/a><figcaption>Emma Frost using Cerebra<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Cerebro\/Cerebra's has the ability to magnified a telepaths abilities to extreme levels.

It first appeared as the Helmet of Power in the one-shot book Iron Man and Sub-Mariner vol 1 #1 (April, 1968). Its true appearance was revealed in Sub-Mariner vol 1 #9 (January, 1969).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Serpent Crown is a powerful mystical and very dangerous object which is worn upon the head. It confers the ability to read and control minds (anyone within the sound of the voice of the one wearing the crown), superhuman strength, the power to levitate and telekinetically move others and objects, it bestows the ability to create elaborate illusions, and the crown can project massively destructive bolts of mystical energy and even the ability to manipulate energy and matter.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The crown was created by a race of Serpent Men (who had been created by <a href=\"\/set\/4005-29092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\">Set <\/a>himself millennia before) allied with <a href=\"\/lemurians\/4060-36925\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-36925\">Lemurian <\/a>scientists under the direction of the Serpent God, to allow them a conduit to their god.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, when the Serpent Men were about to access the power of the Crown the Great Cataclysm occurred. This event wrought disasters all over the world, sink both <a href=\"\/atlantis\/4020-41030\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis <\/a>and <a href=\"\/lemuria\/4020-55791\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\">Lemuria <\/a>and killing most of the remaining Serpent Men. The Crown itself would be lost for centuries.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Finally unearthed by a new race of Lemurians (Homo mermanus), their Emperor, <a href=\"\/naga\/4005-29577\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29577\">Naga<\/a> donned the Crown and immediately fell under the control of the Serpent God. Naga wore the Crown for years, rarely taking it off and used its powers in the name of Set. Over time exposure to the Crown altered his appearance, his skin went from a pale blue to a scaly green; also over the years the Crown\u2019s influence was also felt by the general populous altering them similarly.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually, the Crown was stolen from Naga as he slept by a rebel named Pyscatos. He and his allies fled to Antarctica where they began a civilization known as the \u201cAncients\u201d, they are able to develop telepathy and other similar mental powers through the careful use of the Serpent Crown, but manage to stave off control by encasing the Crown in an unknown substance changing its appearance. These safety measures would prove to not be enough as finally Pyscatos fell under the control of Set and he caused a landslide which ended the \u2018Ancient\u2019 civilization. Again, the Serpent Crown was buried and lost, where it remained until the 20th century.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1920 Captain Leonard Mckenzie led an expedition to Antarctica where one of the members of the party, Paul Destine, discovered an odd helmet. Donning the \u201cHelmet of Power\u201d, Destine found that his latent psionic powers were awakened and greatly increased and his strength is greatly augmented as well. Thought lost by the rest of the expedition he is left there, but he survives by use of the remaining \u2018Ancient\u2019 technology to put himself in suspended animation. Emerging decades later, Destine found his powers further increased from his time in suspended animation.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Calling himself <a href=\"\/destiny\/4005-43467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43467\">Destiny<\/a>, he returned to the American continent just after World War II and made a bid at world domination, but was opposed by the son of Captain Mckenzie himself, <a href=\"\/namor\/4005-1476\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor<\/a>. After Destiny swiftly defeated Namor and left him an amnesiac for decades.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Eventually Namor arose again to battle Destiny, and during their battle Destiny\u2019s mind snapped he attempted to use his power without the Helmet and fell to his death when he thought he could levitate. Namor took the Helmet and returned with it to Atlantis.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There the Serpent Crown begins to overcome its protective casing and mentally takes Namor\u2019s consort, <a href=\"\/dorma\/4005-12601\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Lady Dorma<\/a>, under its control and through her the rest of the Kingdom. Namor then dons the Helmet himself and through force of will frees the Atlanteans. <a href=\"\/karthon\/4005-29564\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29564\">Karthon <\/a>the Quester eventually recovered the Crown along with <a href=\"\/namor\/4005-1476\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor <\/a>as a prisoner and returned to Lemuria. Naga quickly wore the Crown upon Karthon's return and Namor stood defiant against Naga.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Namor and Naga soon engaged each other in battle while Karthon, observing Namor's nobility and Naga's sadism, was having regrets about serving Naga. Namor was about to be swallowed up by a pit created by Naga when Karthon drew his sword and killed Naga.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Namor and Karthon left the Crown on Naga and the creation of the pit caused earthquakes that swallowed Naga and the Crown beneath the ocean floor.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Crown is recovered by Warlord <a href=\"\/krang\/4005-13401\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13401\">Krang <\/a>who delivers it to the superhuman criminal, Viper who in turn kidnaps the President of Roxxon Oil and places the Serpent Crown upon his head.

Scarlet Witch engages the Serpent God on the astral plane, distracting it, as Thing manages to get close enough to Jones to remove the Crown from his head.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Serpent Crown is brought to Project: PEGASUS for study. Set exerts its influence yet again taking over the entire facility, including the then head-of-security, Quasar. The staff begins working to transport serpent Crowns from all the other dimensions to merge them with the original from Earth-616. They amass 770 such Crowns and merge them into one giant Crown in which to summon the Serpent God, but before they can finish the spell <a href=\"\/doctor-strange\/4005-1456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange<\/a>, <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-man<\/a>, Thing, and Scarlet Witch intervene and use the Cosmic Cube to destroy the giant Serpent Crown.

The similar kryptonite also appeared in <a href=\"\/superman-iii\/4025-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-6\"><em>Superman III<\/em><\/a> movie. Although this version of green kryptonite was laced with tar. The tar-laced kryptonite acted like a red kryptonite that removed Superman's inhibitions.

Green Kryptonite can weaken those of Kryptonian descent (weakening powers and abilities as well as strength), and in large enough doses or for long enough time it is lethal. In Smallville Green Kryptonite grants normal humans or other life mutations that make them super-powered and on most occasions psychotic. Here it also weakens Clark, at varying degrees including simply making him a little more human or leaving him on the brink of death. In New 52 appearances, the Kryptonite is again referred to as being rare, is shown that can be used as an energy source, to kryptonian rockets and possible to other vehicles. The mineral doesn't take away the Superman's powers, but is able to decrease it.

The double-forked blade is undetectable by metal detectors or any other security measures, yet its steel blade is razor sharp.

It was passed onto Nico when Tina tried to stab her with the staff, but Nico's body managed to absorb it without ill effects.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Staff of One is used by simply stating a word or phrase, and a spell that relates to that word or phase will occur (e.g. saying \"Smoke\" would cause the Staff of One to release smoke, or \"Caffeine Injection\" charges the target with additional energy). The major limitation of the Staff of One is the fact that each spell can only be used once; if any spell is attempted again the staff will instead have a completely random effect.<\/p><p>To release the Staff of One Nico must bleed and instinctively repeats the phrase, \"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge!\". It also passes through the middle of her sternum, appearing through whatever clothing she is wearing at the time and piercing anything directly in front of Nico. Anyone can use the Staff of One, even without training or magical affinity, which is partially explained as everyone having magic but most people needing tools to bring it out.<\/p><p>On the Runaway's trip to New York City, in the year 1907, <a href=\"\/nico-minoru\/4005-1940\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1940\"> Nico <\/a>got caught breaking into a bank that supposedly had a means to get back home.

After a while the <a href=\"\/witchbreaker\/4005-54963\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54963\"> Witchbreaker <\/a>deemed her worthy. Nico withstood unimaginable pain and this enabled her to gain far greater magics and transformed the appearance of the Staff of One.

Without a healing factor it is poisonous inside the body.","description":"<h2>History<\/h2><p>Adamantium is a virtually indestructible man-made steel alloy which does not occur in nature and whose exact chemical composition is a United States government classified secret. Adamantium is not an element: its properties do not qualify it for any known space on the Periodic Table of Elements. Rather, adamantium is a series of three closely-related compounds of Iron created through a secret process discovered by the metallurgist, Dr. <a href=\"\/myron-maclain\/4005-60582\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60582\">Myron MacLain<\/a>.<\/p><p>MacLain began experimenting with the process that creates adamantium as a young scientist in the employ of the United States government in the early 1940s. By accident he created a special adamantium compound, which is more durable than any form of adamantium created since, and then through another accident, fused this adamantium sample he had created with a sample of an unknown metal catalyst and the metal which is now known to have been Wakandan <a href=\"\/vibranium\/4055-40919\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium<\/a>. The result was the large rounded specimen of alloy which is the most virtually indestructible substance known to man. This alloy specimen was given to <a href=\"\/captain-america\/4005-1442\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America<\/a> to serve as his Shield. The exact chemical composition of <a href=\"\/captain-americas-shield\/4055-50737\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">Captain America's shield<\/a> and the exact degree to which it is indestructible have never been determined, nor has MacLain or anyone else ever learned how to duplicate either the special adamantium compound used in the creation of the shield, which Is known as Proto-Adamantium, or the process which fused the Proto-Adamantium with the Wakandan Vibranium.<\/p><p>Over the following decades, MacLain experimented, attempting to duplicate the process that created adamantium. Finally, in recent years, although he realized that he could never again create Proto-Adamantium, he succeeded in developing the process by which the substance known as True Adamantium is created. True Adamantium is nearly as strong as the Proto-Adamantium used to create Captain America's shield, and is, for virtually all practical purposes, indestructible. The degree of indestructibility varies directly with the thickness of the adamantium. A direct blow from Thor's hammer, <a href=\"\/mjolnir\/4055-40971\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir<\/a>, conveyed with the thunder god's full strength, will only slightly dent a solid cylinder of true adamantium. A sufficient mass of adamantium could survive a direct hit from a nuclear weapon.<\/p><p>Adamantium is created through the mixing of certain chemical resins whose composition is a United States government secret. For eight minutes after the resins are mixed, the adamantium can be molded into a particular shape as long as it is kept at a temperature of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. After this brief period, the process of creating adamantium is completed, and it is cured. The extremely stable molecular structure of the adamantium prevents it from being molded further, even if the temperature remains high enough to keep it in liquid form.

Someone with super-strength (say the <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>) can break it or warp it.

As a side effect of bonding true adamantium with his bones, and his rapid healing ability there was a molecular change which has adapted adamantium to the biology of normal bone.

Upon closer inspection and the application of a little logic, it's becomes apparent that though Hulk did rip Wolverine apart, he didn't actually break adamantium. For the clearest explanation as to why Wolverine's spine, but not the adamantium, could be broken, read the following.<\/p><p><i>Satyrquaze says:<\/i><\/p><blockquote><p>\"As far as Hulk breaking Wolverine in half... (quick biology and metallurgy lesson here) Despite propaganda saying otherwise, Wolverine's skeleton is not completely coated with adamantium, if it were he couldn't move. Adamantium porously coats each bone individually (and it would have to be porous because blood and oxygen is required to get inside the bone to the marrow for a person to live). Also there is a malleable disc between each bone (especially in vertebrae in the spine) which allows freedom of movement along with joints and ligaments(which wouldn't be coated in adamantium if Wolverine hopes to do things like walk, stand, move in the slightest...).Now what Hulk did was indeed rip Logan apart, but it's most likely that Wolverine's spine separated at it's weakest point (the discs between each vertebra) and everything tore apart quite easily from there. So no, Hulk more than likely didn't break adamantium at all in this instance. Not to say that he couldn't if suitably pissed.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Hulk can damage adamantium, or at least adamantium alloys (as seen below), but he did not do so in this instance.<\/p><h4><b>Adamantium Ball<\/b><\/h4><p>In <a href=\"\/marvel-team-up\/4050-2576\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2576\">MARVEL TEAM-UP<\/a> #18, Hulk fought the villain Blastaar in a factory built with an adamantium alloy (not true admantium).
